##### Purpose and features
A list of how your app addresses each of the requirements (iOS / Backend)

iOS

The iOS portion of the project must contain the following components that have learned in class:
AutoLayout using NSLayoutConstraint or SnapKit
At least one UICollectionView or UITableView

UI CollectionView used for filtering courses

Some form of navigation (UINavigationController or UITabBarController) to navigate between screens

UITabBarController used for switching between the three pages.

Integration with an API - this API must provide some meaningful value to your app. For example, if youâ€™re creating a music app, you could use the Apple Music API. Most of you will integrate with an API written by students in the backend course.

API for searching the course.

##### Backend

The Backend fulfills our iOS client's needs by servicing GET requests for information, which can provide all classes, all research belonging to a class, and all faculty teaching a class. It can also return specific research by id and specific faculty by id, allowing all faculty and research to be displayed in the app.
