Some screenshots of your app (highlight important features)
##### Important features

A short description of your app (its purpose and features)

Cornell Wiki enables people who are interested in Cornell to search for anything
that they are curious about Cornell.

It has a general search page, a filter page and a favorite page.

General search: Search anything by keyword
Filter system: Search courses by credits, requirements, etc.
Favorite: Add anything interested

##### Purpose and features
A list of how your app addresses each of the requirements (iOS / Backend)

iOS

The iOS portion of the project must contain the following components that have learned in class:
AutoLayout using NSLayoutConstraint or SnapKit
At least one UICollectionView or UITableView

UI CollectionView used for filtering courses

Some form of navigation (UINavigationController or UITabBarController) to navigate between screens

UITabBarController used for switching between the three pages.

Integration with an API - this API must provide some meaningful value to your app. For example, if you’re creating a music app, you could use the Apple Music API. Most of you will integrate with an API written by students in the backend course.

API for searching the course.

Backend

The backend portion of the project must include:
Designing an API, using database modeling, and implementing it using the Flask boilerplate code provided - it’s totally fine to write a wrapper for an existing API. Consider what changes you will need to fit the iOS client’s needs and how to model the data appropriately in a database.
Deployment to Google Cloud - make sure you start on deployment early! It’s extremely easy to get wrong and can be tricky to debug.
